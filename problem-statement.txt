Service Description:
This service is a backend for a sports app.
It has 3 entities - Sport, Tour and Match.
Each sport has multiple tours and each tour has multiple matches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem 1
Endpoint /tour/matches returns all the matches for a given tour name.
The endpoint latency increases linearly with the number of tours. Modify the endpoint to increase the performance.

Solution: Changed Left join between matches and tour table to inner join to avoid matches table load and also added colum alias name.
Added pagination support to decrease latency of endpoint with MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 5.

Problem 2
Modify the endpoint /sport/tour/match to also return match's id, startTime and format

Solution: in Current code, it is returning list of matches with match name.
I changed list of string(matchName) to list dict/hashmap to handle matchId, matchName, matchFormat, matchStartTime.
eg. {
                    "matchId": 5,
                    "matchName": "BLR vs BEN",
                    "matchFormat": "soccer",
                    "matchStartTime": "2023-04-29T12:30:00.000Z"
                }
i can also convert above data into string format(csv format) if required
eg "5,BLR vs BEN,soccer,2023-04-29T12:30:00.000Z"

Problem 3

Functional Requirements:
    1. News can be created for a match or a tour.
    2. Each news created for a match also belongs to the corresponding tour.

Technical Requirements:
    1. Create an endpoint to create news.
    2. Create an endpoint to fetch news by match id
    3. Create an endpoint to fetch news by tour id
    4. Create an endpoint to fetch news by sport id
